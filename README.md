# What's the purpose?
Anki has a much richer ecosystem than we know. Thanks to their terrible deck search, discovering decks that have been made and shared by others is difficult if not impossible. How can you search for something you don't know exists? 

The primary goal of this project is to scrape the API and form a large, searchable collection of community content for people to discover new and interesting things with. 

# Current Problem
  - Anki API rate limits. Botfarm?
